# agent_bricks_workshop_resources
This repo contains resources for the September 17th Databricks Agent Bricks workshop. In this workshop, we will create a multi-agent system that combines text-to-SQL and a knowledge assistant which will allow end users to ask many different types of questions and receive the appropriate answer.
